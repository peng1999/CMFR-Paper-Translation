In this paper, we propose a novel controllable multi-interest framework for the sequential recommendation. Our framework uses a multi-interest extraction module to generate multiple user interests and uses an aggregation module to obtain the overall top-N items. 
Experimental results demonstrate that our models can achieve significant improvements over start-of-the-art models on two challenging datasets. Our framework has also been successfully deployed on the Alibaba distributed cloud platform. Results on the billion-scale industrial dataset further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework in practice. Recommender systems start a new phase owing to the rapid development of deep learning. Traditional recommendation methods cannot meet the requirements of the industry. For the future, we plan to leverage memory networks to capture the evolving interests of users and introduce cognitive theory to make better user modeling.
